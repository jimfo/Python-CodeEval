# TITLE : Find a Writer from CODE EVAL
# AUTHOR : James Fody
# DESCRIPTION :  You have a set of rows with names of famous writers encoded inside.
#   Each row is divided into 2 parts by pipe char (|). The first part has a writer's name.
#   The second part is a "key" to generate a name.
#   Your goal is to go through each number in the key
#   (numbers are separated by space) left-to-right.
#   Each number represents a position in the 1st part of a row.
#   This way you collect a writer's name which you have to output.
