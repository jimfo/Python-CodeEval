# Title : Find the Highest Score by CodeEval
# Author : James Fody
# Description : Each line includes a test case with a table. Table rows are separated by pipes '|'. 
# All table rows contain scores for each category, so all lines are of an equal length. 
# Print the highest score for each category.
