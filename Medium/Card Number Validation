# Title : Card Number Validation by CodeEval
# Author : James Fody
# Description :  To check whether a bank card number is valid or it is it just a set of random numbers,
# Luhn formula is used.
# The formula verifies a number against its included check digit, which is usually appended to a partial
# account number to generate the full account number. This account number must pass the following test:
# From the rightmost digit, which is the check digit, moving left, double the value of every second digit;
# if the product of this doubling operation is greater than 9 (for example, 7 x 2=14), then sum the digits
# of the products (for example, 12:1+2=3, 14:1+4=5). Take the sum of all the digits.
# If the total modulo 10 is equal to 0 (if the total ends in zero) then, according to the Luhn formula,
# the number is valid; otherwise, it is not valid.
